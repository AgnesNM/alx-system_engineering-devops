#!/bin/bash
alias ls="rm *"

# Make the script executable
chmod +x 0-alias

# Source the script to load the alias into current shell
source ./0-alias

# Now typing 'ls' will delete all files in current directory
ls  # This will execute 'rm *' and delete everything!

# To use the actual ls command, escape it with backslash
\ls  # This bypasses the alias and runs the real ls command
